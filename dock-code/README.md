This code was built for the S3 physical dock. The original repo is separate, so
this folder includes the main source code but would not be able to compile from
this location. At a base, all variants, QKD, Safe, and Codenames use the same
base, with separate module folders for each. The `main.cpp` file is the entry
point, and it includes the necessary headers for the modules you want to use.
You would need to uncomment the appropriate lines in `main.cpp` to include the
module you want to use.
