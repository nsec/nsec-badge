 * \brief CryptoAuthLib Basic API methods for DeriveKey command.
 *
 * The DeriveKey command combines the current value of a key with the nonce
 * stored in TempKey using SHA-256 and derives a new key.
 *
 * \note List of devices that support this command - ATSHA204A, ATECC108A,
 *       ATECC508A, and ATECC608A/B. There are differences in the modes that they
 *       support. Refer to device datasheets for full details.
